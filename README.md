## Data Science Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning

- The app begins with data cleaning, ensuring that all irrelevant or missing values are addressed. This step is crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring accurate predictions. 🧹

### 2. Data Exploration

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to visualize weather patterns and trends. Graphs and charts illustrate the relationships between different weather variables, helping to understand the underlying data structure. 🔍

### 3. Feature Extraction

- Important features are identified and extracted from the dataset to train the prediction model effectively. This process improves the model's accuracy by focusing on the most influential data points. 🛠️

### 4. Prediction Model

- A Random Forest Classifier is employed to predict rain based on the processed data. This model is known for its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets. 🌳

### 5. Data Visualization

- After predictions are made, data visualizations such as accuracy scores and confusion matrices are displayed, providing clear insights into the model's performance and reliability. 📈
